      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>
        Hi there! I am Arkell, and I am an enthusiastic web developer always
        eager to take on new challenges and broaden my knowledge. Besides
        coding, you can find me enjoying a great workout at the gym, reading a
        book, or immersing myself in the latest video game.
      </p>
      <p>
        My passion for technology inspired me to pursue a degree in Computer
        Science at North Carolina A&T State University. As a web developer, I am
        committed to bringing ingenuity, functionality, and user-friendly design
        to every project.
